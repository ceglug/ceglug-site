<p>CEGLUG is CEG's GNU/Linux Users Group. The FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) enthusiasts of our college came together to form this group under the banner of ACM Student's Chapter, Anna University. The official inauguration took place on 4th of January 2008 at DCSE’s Seminar Hall with address by Dr. Ranjani Parthasarathy.  
</p>
</p> Over the past few years, the focus of CEGLUG has been to introduce students to the world of FOSS. This, it has been doing successfully since its inception. During its initial years, CEGLUG was active through google-groups where they held technical discussions promoting collaborative learning. 
</p>
<p> A remarkable achievement of CEGLUG is the eshtablishment of the TCS Linux Lab (2008) in the third floor of the DCSE by installing Ubuntu 7.10 in each and every machine and also establishing a Desktop Sharing (VNC) and File Sharing (SSH) facility in it. With the help of this facility, the desktop appearing in the instructor's end was be made available at the student's computer. 
</p> 
<p>In the recent years, CEGLUG has made rapid progress. As part of its activities relugar classes are conducted for students, introducing them to free software alternatives. On September 13th 2013, CEGLUG was registered as an official club of CEG. Till date, it has been effectively propagating its motto “Freedom matters” in every step it takes. CEGLUG is all set to launch its own Linux Distribution soon.
</p>
<p>The CEGLUG does not restrict itself to introducing students to FOSS. It has been instrumental in encouraging students to contribute to various Free and Open source projects. Every year students have been participating in Google Summer Of Code (GSOC). Women students are also motivated to participate in initiatives like the Rails girls summer of code and Gnome women's outreach program.
