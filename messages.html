<h2>Asst. Professor Bama Ma'am</h2>
<blockquote>
    <p><small>
    As the world shrinks and as technology expands,
</small></p>
<p> <small>
    With free knowledge abundant as situation demands;
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Ready sources to dip into, in this information age
</small></p>
<p><small>
    And together build the world as one global village;
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Connected by web and accessible by everyone
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Created by us, nurtured by all, but excluding none -
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Through this initiative that aims for the sun,
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Let us join, learn, contribute and enjoy all the fun
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Free knowledge, free sharing, and unrestricted access - 
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Of us, By us, and for all is our only mantra for success!
</small></p>
<p><small>
    To implement new ideas and fearlessly share,
</small></p>
<p><small>
    This is the place, this is the camaraderie: Come here friends.We surely care.
</small></p>
<p><small>
    Let us all join, break new grounds and hoodwink luck.
</small></p>
<p><small>
    This is the place! This is the site! This is IT! And this is what we call CEGLUG!
</small></p>
